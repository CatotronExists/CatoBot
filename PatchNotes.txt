V0.4 - 2/06/2023 - [The Database Update]
This update Brings Database storage to CatoBot.
I had planned to also release Moderation tools with this update. But due to how long the database took to setup I have pushed moderation to the next version
The moderation tools have been added but dont do anything yet, its more of a placeholder for now. 

This update is important, as all future versions will be built of this new database so it was important that I got it right the first time.
Hopefully nothing goes wrong and the next update should not take as long as this one has. 
- Catotron

and if there are any issues create one here: https://github.com/CatotronExists/CatoBot/issues :)

Additions
- Permanent bot hosting
    The bot is only online when I am testing it, starting from the launch of v0.4 the bot will always be online.
    I have made a Testing bot so I can keep working while the bot is online 

- Database
    - Total Commands now saves when you use a command
    - Tracks how many times each command has been used
    - User stats are also saved 
        - For now only messages, commands and user join date are saved
    - Powered by MongoDB

- Dev mode switch
    - Since there is now a "live" bot and a "testing" bot I have added a simple switch between them
- More work towards API calls


New Commands
- user_lookup
    - Get stats for a user
    - Shows join date, messages sent and commands used
    - Any user that joined before this update will have a join time set to midnight UTC of the date they joined (2-03-2022 13:49:12 -> 2-03-2023 00:00:00)

- command_leaderboard
    - Shows how much each command has been used (sorted from most to least)

Changes
    
- Starting Value for Commands_Used is no longer able to be changed due to the new system
    (I might be able to bring it back later, but for now it has been removed)

    - This patches to ability to use locked commands in DMs
    I do have plans to add features exclusive to bot DMs in future
