V0.4.2 - 16/06/2023 - [The Database Update: Patch 2]
Bot was slow so I made it faster

Additions
- Introducing asynchronous database requests
    - All commands now call from and to the database asynchronously
    - Improved preformance by alot

Changes
- Shutdown system disabled in DEV mode 
- If a user hasn't sent a message or a command /user_lookup will now show a 0 instead of an error message
- Updated "made by" in /bot_stats username to my new discord handle (@Catotron)
    - also updated in /user_lookup when a join date cant be found
    - the @ looks better I dont care :/

Fixes
- Fixed "UTC" being shown at the end of the error when the join date for that user doesnt exist when using /user_lookup
- Fixed /command_leaderboard not responding fast enough
    - The bot now sends a "loading" message to get around discord 3 second response window
- Fixed bot crash caused by using /command_leaderboard when at least one command had no uses

Known Issues
- The commands sent sometimes increases for the wrong user when /user_lookup is used
    - For some reason the bot thinks the author is the user in the "user: " field 
- /user_lookup shows "#0" if the user searched has migrated to the new username system

V0.4.1 - 7/06/2023 - [The Database Update: Patch 1]
Minor patch to fix some major issues that the last update created

Additions
- Version name is now different when in dev mode

Fixes
- Fixed where anyone could use /shutdown
- Fixed where some commands would not respond, (Well it would just not fast enough for Discord)
    - Saving to the database now happens after bot response is sent
        (This also makes the bot response alot faster, but doesnt apply to all commands)
- Fixed where /shutdown wouldnt work unless done twice, (Because the bot hoster attempts to auto reboot the bot when it crashes. Unless the bot crash twice in 60sec)
    - Added a system allowing /shutdown to work with the bot hosting service
    - This also fixes the shutdown command not always working

Known Issues
- /command_leaderboard still doesnt respond fast enough (This command has been disabled for now)
- Bot crash caused by using /command_leaderboard when at least one command has no uses
- UTC is still shown if user has no join date when using /user_lookup

V0.4 - 2/06/2023 - [The Database Update]
This update Brings Database storage to CatoBot.
I had planned to also release Moderation tools with this update. But due to how long the database took to setup I have pushed moderation to the next version
The moderation tools have been added but dont do anything yet, its more of a placeholder for now. 

This update is important, as all future versions will be built of this new database so it was important that I got it right the first time.
Hopefully nothing goes wrong and the next update should not take as long as this one has. 
- Catotron

and if there are any issues create one here: https://github.com/CatotronExists/CatoBot/issues :)

Additions

    The bot is only online when I am testing it, starting from the launch of v0.4 the bot will always be online.
    I have made a Testing bot so I can keep working while the bot is online 

- Database
    - Total Commands now saves when you use a command
    - Tracks how many times each command has been used
    - User stats are also saved 
        - For now only messages, commands and user join date are saved
    - Powered by MongoDB

- Dev mode switch
    - Since there is now a "live" bot and a "testing" bot I have added a simple switch between them
- More work towards API calls


New Commands

    - Get stats for a user
    - Shows join date, messages sent and commands used

- command_leaderboard
    - Shows how much each command has been used (sorted from most to least)

Changes
    
- Starting Value for Commands_Used is no longer able to be changed due to the new system
    (I might be able to bring it back later, but for now it has been removed)

    - This patches to ability to use locked commands in DMs
    I do have plans to add features exclusive to bot DMs in future

- Terminal Startup Messages have been changed slightly
- Terminal now shows what command was used
- bot_stats command now shows date the bot started up
- ??the start of something larger??

Fixes
